## Description

> First of all, I must say do not laugh at me because I am not very good English

I am building an flutter app for daily income and expenses from one of the udemy trainings. I decided to put it in the GitHub for you with a strong document while learning it. I hope you like it and if you have an idea, add it or tell me.

> I hope you will accompany and support me in this way.
